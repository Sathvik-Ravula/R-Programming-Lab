# R language is mostly used for statistics and data analytics purposes to represent the data graphically in the software. To represent those data graphically,
# charts and graphs are used in R. 

# R â€“ graphs
# There are hundreds of charts and graphs present in R. For example, bar plot, box plot, mosaic plot, 
# dot chart, coplot, histogram, pie chart, scatter graph, etc. 

#PIE CHART

perc <- round(100 * cylinders / sum(cylinders), 1)
# Create the pie chart
pie(cylinders, labels = paste(names(cylinders), " (", perc, "%)"), col = colors)
title(main = "Number of Cylinders in mtcars")

#BARPLOT

#MODE

# There is no built-in function in R to calculate the mode directly, 
# so we have to use a custom function to find the mode as shown above. 
# In the above code, we are first creating a frequency table of the vector using table(), 
# sorting it in descending order using sort(), and then selecting the first element of the 
# resulting vector using names() to get the mode.
